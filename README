## This is a python Flask application for YouTube channel analytics
This project requires a few things I can't give you to work:
## database/config.py file

```
import mysql.connector

db_config = {
    'host': 'endpoint_to_amazon_RDS',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'database': 'name_of_database'
}

def create_db_connection():
    return mysql.connector.connect(**db_config)
```
## YouTube API access and KEY
API key stored in file 'key' in root of project.   
Follow instructions at https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started.  
youtube-api.json file stored in root of project as well.

## Access to AWS and all that jazz.
